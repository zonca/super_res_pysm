# Super Resolution modeling of PySM simulations

In this repository we show our progress  in the modeling of super resolutions images with PySM. 

## PySM simulations and analysis
In the Notebook `generate_galactic_dust_realization` we do some exploration of [PySM](https://pysm3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) simulations, [pixell](https://pixell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (to convert sky map to 2D), pillow usage, saving figures...
